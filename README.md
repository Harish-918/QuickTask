# QuickTask - React Todo App

QuickTask is a simple and intuitive to-do list application built with React. It allows users to add tasks, toggle their completion status, and delete tasks. All tasks are stored in the browser's localStorage, ensuring that your tasks persist even after the page is refreshed.

## Features

- **Add Tasks**: Quickly add new tasks to your to-do list.
- **Toggle Task Completion**: Mark tasks as completed or pending by clicking on them.
- **Remove Tasks**: Delete tasks from the list.
- **Persistence**: All tasks are saved in the browser's `localStorage`, so your data is retained even if the page is refreshed.
- **Task Sorting**: Tasks are automatically sorted with incomplete tasks shown first, and within those, the most recently added tasks appear first.

## Installation

To run the app locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/quicktask.git
   ```

2. Navigate into the project folder:
   ```bash
   cd quicktask
   ```

3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

5. Open your browser and go to `http://localhost:3000` to view the app.

## Usage

- **Add a Task**: Type the task name in the input field and click "Add Task" or press Enter.
- **Complete a Task**: Click on the task text to toggle its completion status. Completed tasks will appear crossed out.
- **Remove a Task**: Click the "Remove" button next to the task to delete it from the list.
  
## Technologies Used

- **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **localStorage**: Used to persist tasks in the browser even after a page reload.
