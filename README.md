# QuickTask - React Todo App

QuickTask is a simple and intuitive to-do list application built with React. It allows users to add tasks, toggle their completion status, and delete tasks. All tasks are stored in the browser's localStorage, ensuring that your tasks persist even after the page is refreshed.

## Features

- *Add Tasks*: Quickly add new tasks to your to-do list.
- *Toggle Task Completion*: Mark tasks as completed or pending by clicking on them.
- *Remove Tasks*: Delete tasks from the list.
- *Persistence*: All tasks are saved in the browser's `localStorage`, so your data is retained even if the page is refreshed.
- *Task Sorting*: Tasks are automatically sorted with incomplete tasks shown first, and within those, the most recently added tasks appear first.

## Installation
